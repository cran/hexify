\usage{
hex_grid(
  area_km2 = NULL,
  resolution = NULL,
  aperture = 3,
  resround = "nearest",
  crs = 4326L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area_km2}{Target cell area in square kilometers. Mutually exclusive
with \code{resolution}.}

\item{resolution}{Grid resolution level (0-30). Mutually exclusive with
\code{area_km2}.}

\item{aperture}{Grid aperture: 3 (default), 4, 7, or "4/3" for mixed.}

\item{resround}{Resolution rounding when using \code{area_km2}:
"nearest" (default), "up", or "down".}

\item{crs}{Coordinate reference system EPSG code (default 4326 = 'WGS84').}
}
\value{
A HexGridInfo object containing the grid specification.
}
\description{
Creates a HexGridInfo object that stores all parameters needed for hexagonal
grid operations. Use this to define the grid once and pass it to all
downstream functions.
}
\details{
Exactly one of \code{area_km2} or \code{resolution} must be provided.

When \code{area_km2} is provided, the resolution is calculated automatically
using the cell count formula: N = 10 * aperture^res + 2.
}
\section{One Grid, Many Datasets}{


A HexGridInfo acts as a shared spatial reference system - like a CRS, but
discrete and equal-area. Define the grid once, then attach multiple
datasets without repeating parameters:

\preformatted{
# Step 1: Define the grid once
grid <- hex_grid(area_km2 = 1000)

# Step 2: Attach multiple datasets to the same grid
birds <- hexify(bird_obs, lon = "longitude", lat = "latitude", grid = grid)
mammals <- hexify(mammal_obs, lon = "lon", lat = "lat", grid = grid)
climate <- hexify(weather_stations, lon = "x", lat = "y", grid = grid)

# No aperture, resolution, or area needed after step 1 - the grid
# travels with the data.

# Step 3: Work at the cell level
# Once hexified, lon/lat no longer matter - cell_id is the shared key
bird_counts <- aggregate(species ~ cell_id, data = as.data.frame(birds), length)
mammal_richness <- aggregate(species ~ cell_id, data = as.data.frame(mammals),
                             function(x) length(unique(x)))

# Join datasets by cell_id - guaranteed to align because same grid
combined <- merge(bird_counts, mammal_richness, by = "cell_id")

# Step 4: Visual confirmation
# All datasets produce identical grid overlays
plot(birds)   # See the grid
plot(mammals) # Same grid, different data
}
}

\examples{
# Create grid by target area
grid <- hex_grid(area_km2 = 1000)
print(grid)

# Create grid by resolution
grid <- hex_grid(resolution = 8, aperture = 3)

# Create grid with different aperture
grid4 <- hex_grid(area_km2 = 500, aperture = 4)

# Create mixed aperture grid
grid43 <- hex_grid(area_km2 = 1000, aperture = "4/3")

# Use grid in hexify
df <- data.frame(lon = c(0, 10, 20), lat = c(45, 50, 55))
result <- hexify(df, lon = "lon", lat = "lat", grid = grid)
