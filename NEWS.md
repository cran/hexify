# hexify 0.3.10

**Hotfix for geometry issues**

* Fixed invalid pentagon geometries that caused gaps in global grids
* Fixed antimeridian-crossing polygons using `st_wrap_dateline()`
* Added polar cap sampling to `grid_global()` to include cells above ±85° latitude

# hexify 0.3.6

* Reduced test suite runtime for CRAN by skipping detailed consistency tests
  (full tests still run locally via NOT_CRAN=true)
* Fixed CRAN incoming check NOTE: "Overall checktime 15 min > 10 min"

# hexify 0.3.5

* Simplified plot examples to reduce runtime
* Added non-standard files to .Rbuildignore
* Fixed slow example NOTE

# hexify 0.3.4

**Hotfix for CRAN UBSAN check failure**

* Fixed undefined behavior in Snyder ISEA projection causing NaN values
  (UBSAN error on M1 Mac CRAN check: "nan is outside the range of representable
  values of type 'long long'" at coordinate_transforms.cpp:243-244)
* Root cause: floating-point precision in face assignment could project points
  onto geometrically invalid triangle faces near icosahedron edges
* Solution: added projection validation with face-retry logic - if validation
  fails (z > DH), automatically tries adjacent faces until valid
