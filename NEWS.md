# hexify 0.6.5

* Fixed empty translation unit warning in vendored H3 `h3Assert.c`
  (clang 21 `-Wempty-translation-unit`)

# hexify 0.6.4

* Removed compiled object files (`.o`) from source tarball that caused
  installation failure on Linux (Debian) and NOTE on all platforms
* Wrapped `plot_globe()` examples in `\donttest{}` to reduce check time
  (was 608s on win-builder)
* Reworded DESCRIPTION to avoid "vendored" spelling flag

# hexify 0.6.3

* `cell_to_sf()` now applies `sf::st_wrap_dateline()` automatically, fixing
  horizontal streaks on flat map projections (Plate Carrée, Robinson, etc.) for
  hexagons crossing the ±180° antimeridian
* `as_sf(x, geometry = "polygon")` now routes all grids (ISEA and H3) through
  `cell_to_sf()`, ensuring consistent antimeridian handling
* `hexify_cell_to_sf()` gains antimeridian normalization matching `cell_to_sf()`
* Vignettes no longer require manual `st_wrap_dateline()` calls

# hexify 0.6.2

**Native H3 backend — zero external dependencies**

* Vendored H3 v4.4.1 C source, replacing the `h3o` R package dependency
* H3 is now always available — no optional install, no Suggests
* Uses H3 experimental polygon fill for full spatial coverage in `hexify()`
* New native C++ bindings: `h3_lat_lng_to_cell`, `h3_cell_to_boundary`,
  `h3_cell_to_parent`, `h3_cell_to_children`, `h3_polygon_to_cells`,
  `h3_cell_area_km2`, `h3_cell_to_lat_lng`

# hexify 0.6.1

* Warn when `aperture` is passed with `type = "h3"` (ignored parameter)
* Expanded H3 resolution guidance in `hex_grid()` documentation
* Extended H3 vignette resolution table to full range (0-15)
* Added `h3_crosswalk()` example to H3 vignette

# hexify 0.6.0

**ISEA–H3 crosswalk and per-cell area**

* New `h3_crosswalk()`: bidirectional mapping between ISEA and H3 cell IDs,
  with automatic resolution matching and per-cell area comparison
* New `cell_area()`: returns geodesic area (km²) for each cell — constant for
  ISEA (equal-area), location-dependent for H3, with session-scoped caching
* HexData `$cell_area_km2`, `[["cell_area_km2"]]`, and `as.data.frame()` now
  return per-cell areas for H3 grids instead of the grid-wide average
* Internal: extracted `closest_h3_resolution()` helper shared by `hex_grid()`
  and `h3_crosswalk()`

# hexify 0.5.0

**H3 grid support**

* Added H3 (Uber) as a first-class grid type: `hex_grid(resolution = 8, type = "h3")`
* All core functions work with H3 grids: `hexify()`, `cell_to_sf()`, `grid_rect()`,
  `grid_global()`, `grid_clip()`, `get_parent()`, `get_children()`
* H3 support requires the `h3o` package (Suggests, not required for ISEA workflows)
* New `hexify_compare_resolutions(type = "h3")` for H3 resolution table
* `dgearthstat()` now accepts HexGridInfo objects directly
* New `grid_type` slot on HexGridInfo: `"isea"` (default) or `"h3"`
* HexData `cell_id` slot supports character (H3) and numeric (ISEA) cell IDs
* Backward compatible: all existing ISEA workflows unchanged

# hexify 0.3.10

**Hotfix for geometry issues**

* Fixed invalid pentagon geometries that caused gaps in global grids
* Fixed antimeridian-crossing polygons using `st_wrap_dateline()`
* Added polar cap sampling to `grid_global()` to include cells above ±85° latitude

# hexify 0.3.6

* Reduced test suite runtime for CRAN by skipping detailed consistency tests
  (full tests still run locally via NOT_CRAN=true)
* Fixed CRAN incoming check NOTE: "Overall checktime 15 min > 10 min"

# hexify 0.3.5

* Simplified plot examples to reduce runtime
* Added non-standard files to .Rbuildignore
* Fixed slow example NOTE

# hexify 0.3.4

**Hotfix for CRAN UBSAN check failure**

* Fixed undefined behavior in Snyder ISEA projection causing NaN values
  (UBSAN error on M1 Mac CRAN check: "nan is outside the range of representable
  values of type 'long long'" at coordinate_transforms.cpp:243-244)
* Root cause: floating-point precision in face assignment could project points
  onto geometrically invalid triangle faces near icosahedron edges
* Solution: added projection validation with face-retry logic - if validation
  fails (z > DH), automatically tries adjacent faces until valid
